# OneTap
An app that installs quick tiles onto your phone in one tap. Finding one for simple, common utilities is either a chore or expensive, so here's mine

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/swapnil-up/OneTap.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project folder
   ```bash
   cd OneTap
    ```

3. Build the app 


## Usage

All that's really needed is to install the app, that'll allow your phone to recognize the quicktile settings. The app itself is a dummy atm (will include settings in the future hopefully), which does nothing. Just edit quick tiles and add the tile, then one tap to run it.


## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what youâ€™d like to change. 
Anything cool is especially welcome. The main thing is probably that it's a quicktile. 


## Future TODO

- [ ] Add a settings page
- [ ] Add a rantim quicktile

#### For 15 min timer. 
- [ ] Add an icon
- [ ] A notification along with the toast?
- [ ] Increase the chime
- [ ] Option to customize the chime
- [ ] Some way to know that the timer is running. (Change from 15 to 0? Or just turn on?)
